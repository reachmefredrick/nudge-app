# Microsoft Graph API Configuration for Teams Integration
# This configuration enables Microsoft Teams notifications via Graph API (recommended approach)

# Azure AD App Registration Settings
# 1. Go to https://portal.azure.com
# 2. Navigate to "Azure Active Directory" > "App registrations"
# 3. Click "New registration"
# 4. Set redirect URI to: http://localhost:3000 (for development)
# 5. Copy the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID

# NEXT_PUBLIC_AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-azure-app-client-id-here
# NEXT_PUBLIC_AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-azure-tenant-id-here

# Optional: Use 'common' for multi-tenant apps (allows any Microsoft account)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_AZURE_TENANT_ID=common

# Required Permissions for your Azure App:
# - ChannelMessage.Send (Application or Delegated)
# - Team.ReadBasic.All (Application or Delegated) 
# - Channel.ReadBasic.All (Application or Delegated)
# - User.Read (Delegated)

# Production Deployment:
# For production, update redirect URI to your production domain
# Example: https://your-domain.com

# Note: The NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix makes these variables available in the browser
# This is safe for Azure client IDs as they are designed to be public
